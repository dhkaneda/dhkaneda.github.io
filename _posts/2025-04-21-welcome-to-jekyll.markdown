*Init. How stereotypical. I'm sure I am not the first to call their first tech related blog post "Init".*

But who cares! That's a sneak peek into my thoughts. I'm actively working on retraining my brain to be more confident in my work and to share my work without reservations.

Today I teach DevOps, mostly on AWS. It typically involves deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters, writing CICD components, authoring accompanying documentation and tutorials to introduce my students to thewonderful world of DevOps. I tell my students all the time to maintain a growth mindset and to foster confidence in what they are doing through hands-on experience.

But practicing what I preach has been an ongoing struggle, particularly the confidence aspect.

5 years ago, I quit my job teaching at the Academy of Art University's architecture model shop right before the world locked down due to COVID and learn to program at the Hack Reactor bootcamp in San Francisco. I remember, upon graduating, that the first few instances of "I should start a blog" crossed my mind.

Imposter syndrome *was* deeply rooted in my psyche. Coupled with a horrible habit of perfectionism and rarely calling things finished, I had many excuses for never starting a blog. Even while I taught in other domains on carpentry, model making, drafting, I downplayed my perspective and experience in favor of focusing on what I did not know yet.

I'm at a point now where the evidence has been piling up around me and my teammates and students are pointing out that I simply need to give myself more credit. At work, I do not have the time to second guess myself. I push to main regularly and often times my work is in front of the eyes of my peers and users within hours. I write and code often. It is about time I do it in public.

So here it is â€” the first push to main, outside of work, and into the world.
