In a previous life, I was an architect, carpenter, industrial designer...maker.

In this one, I am an engineer working with software, cloud technologies and well...I guess I'm still an Architect (*Solutions*). I currently teach the next generation of cloud engineers at Fortune 50 telecom and insurance companies.

When I'm not in front a screen, I like to read comics, build *Mobile Suit Gundam* models, and spending time with my wife, Boston Terrier, and Holland Lop rabbits.
