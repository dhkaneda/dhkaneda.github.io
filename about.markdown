My name is Dennis Huynh.

When I'm not at my screen, I build Mobile Suit Gundam models, read comics, cook, and work out. I grew up in San Francisco, got over being jaded by the tech boom, learned to code and moved out to the Pacific Northwest with my beloved wife, Boston Terrier, and two Holland Lop bunnies.

I fell in love with computing through the gateway that is the public cloud with AWS and am falling deeper into the rabbit hole of Linux, Kubernetes, and DevOps.

Kaneda, as in Shotaro Kaneda.

Daikon (White Radish), was the name of my late Netherlands Dwarf. He was a much cuter version of Monty Python's Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog.

I cannot decide between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon.
